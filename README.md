[![Node Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-18.14.1-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/nicholas5538/portfolio/blob/main/.nvmrc)

## 游눩 Objective

It's a great opportunity to showcase my frontend skills, and to explore new frameworks and libraries such as **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com 'tailwindcss homepage')** and **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org 'Next.js homepage')**.

## Getting Started

### Repo Setup

- Fork this repo.

  > 游뚿 You can fork this repo and play around with it. But please give me proper credit by linking back to this [repo](https://github.com/nicholas5538/portfolio, 'nicholas5538 portfolio repo') if you're planning to use it. _Plagiarism is bad_ after all.

- Install the version of node specified in the `.nvmrc` file of this repo.

  > 游누 **Tip:** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily manage multiple versions of node. Once installed, run `nvm use` in the project directory to use the configured version.

- Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).
  > 游누 `npm install --global yarn`

## Developing

Once you have [set up the repo](#repo-setup), you're ready to start developing. Starting the development environment is managed by the following command.

```sh
yarn dev
```

The `dev` command will start the application in your local environment.

### Frequently Used Scripts

In addition to the `dev` command, there are other scripts available in the package.json. Some of the most common you might get to use are:

- `yarn test` - Runs unit tests.

  > 游누 **Tip:** use `yarn test:watch` or `yarn test:cov` to explicitly specify the desired mode

- `yarn format` - Check prettier formatting through all the codes
  > 游누 **Tip:** use `yarn format:fix` to run auto prettier formatting across all the codes
- `yarn lint` - Runs TS linter through all the codes
